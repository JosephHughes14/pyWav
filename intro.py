#Sebastian, welcome to python this is a python script/file/code
#(whatever you want to call it)...

#Using hashes how you make comments, comments are not processed 
#when the code is run, you can add comments to describe your code 
#and to make it clear to other people what you are trying to 
#to do.

'''This is also a type of comment
   The difference is you can make comments over multiple lines
   These comments start and end with three quotation marks'''
   
#the next line is the first line of code that will be run 
#when you execute this python file:

x = "Hello World"

#the code above sets the variable x to the string hello world, 
#we know it is a string because it is in quote marks.
#printing is a quick way to see what a variable is set too:

print x

#I intend to use commentsin code to build a small project together 
#that relates to your course (maybe) and we can move this project
#in any direction!
