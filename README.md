Teaching python through wav file manipulation using wave


TIPs and tricks will go in here:

First things first: how to run a python file:

--make sure python is installed and setup properly (I will do this for you)
--open a command prompt (press windows key and r) in the popup box type cmd and hit enter
--just incase you havent seen one of these before this is a comand prompt
--in here we can move up and down your file systems and execute different applications
--anything you can do with a mouse and keyboard normally (using windows) can be done using commands in the cmd window
--to use python simply type ... python (obviously)
--this will take you into an interactive python "shell" it will look like this:

>>

--Try typing in some maths... 4+4 for example, and hit enter
--python is amaingly flexible with syntax, thats why its so great to learn with: you dont get bogged down with fixing missing spaces or extra stuff. for example with the 4+4 four example all of the following will work:

>>4+4
>>4 + 4
>>4+ 4
>>4 +4

--now to run a python file/script/code (what ever you want to call it).... your cmd prompt needs to know where is it..

--for example, if you have a python file name test.py and you have saved it in your My Documents you would run it doing the following:

C:\Sebastian\MyDocuments> python test.py

then hit enter

This will do some magic and execute you file..... I will show you all of this...
